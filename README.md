Sides projects I am working on

##django projects
I am learning how to use django because I want to implement it as the web framework in my group project for CS411.  So far I am just going through the tutorial provided by the django website.

##webscraping
For my research job I do a lot of web scraping and parsing.  I thought as a fun side project I would try to design a generalized web scraping and parsing program.  I am learning how to implement a `settings` file as well to make it customizable.
